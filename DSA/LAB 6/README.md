# Red-Black Tree
This is a Red-Black Tree implementation in C supporting insertion, deletion, and search operations

## Features
- Unique integer keys.
- Functions for insert, delete, search.
- Inorder and preorder traversal output.
- Uses a global NIL node for external nodes.

## Input Format
- The first line will be an integer n, the total number of nodes.
- The second line will be the n integers.
- After that, follow the prompt displayed.

## Output Format
- Inorder and preorder traversals will be printed after every insert and successful delete (an unsuccessful delete will give an error message).
- Searching for a key will print whether the key is present in the Red-Black Tree or not.
